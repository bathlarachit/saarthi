## About 

The application provides realtime navigation functionalities with voice commands so that the users with disabilities could explore the locations on their own.

It it linked to our database which provides the data to the application which is used by user to plan their journey to a location which has personalised features.

Currently it uses google directions api, which provides us the information on the path from the current location to the location of choice. For customization we plan to move this on an open source map to provide additional features.
